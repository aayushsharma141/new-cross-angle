## UX Audit Remediation — 2026-09-10

Full UI/UX audit of the public site published as an 18-entry defect register
(codes CA-01..CA-18). Two P0 entries closed:

- **CA-01 — Semantic token layer wired.** `tokens/index.css` imported the
  legacy 16-line `./semantic.css` instead of the documented
  `./semantic/semantic.css`, so all `var(--s-*)` references resolved to
  nothing. Invalid `border-color` fell back to `currentColor`, painting 17
  intended hairlines pure white on `/contact-us`, and the homepage reveal
  curtain rendered transparent. Fixed additively (the `--color-*`/`--canvas-*`
  legacy namespace is load-bearing and was kept).
  `environments/environments.css` is deliberately still NOT imported: its
  `:root` baseline is GALLERY LIGHT and would invert every consumer to a light
  palette on the dark body. Wire it only with a full light/dark pass.
- **CA-03 — Consent pod moved off the hero CTA** (desktop anchor bottom-left
  -> bottom-right) and its "Accept All" button contrast raised from 2.1:1 to
  9.3:1.

Verified live across `/`, `/about-us`, `/services`, `/gallery`, `/portfolio`,
`/portfolio/:slug`, `/aesthetic-discovery-engine`, `/contact-us`, `/estimate`:
zero unresolved `--s-*` tokens and zero contrast regressions. Admin surfaces
verified statically (`.admin-theme` is dark; canvas/text come from the same
token pair). Rollback point: tag `checkpoint/v18-pre-token-layer-wiring`.

**Still open from the audit:** CA-02 (archive greyscale on touch), CA-04 (no
persistent mobile contact affordance), and CA-05..CA-18. Known separate bug:
`PageTransition` applies a transform that creates a containing block, so
`position: fixed` descendants such as `ScrollToTop` are not viewport-fixed on
any public page.

## Mobile conversion affordance + Gallery surfacing — 2026-09-10

Two audit entries closed on `feature/dam-v3-milestone-planning`:

- **CA-04 — Persistent mobile contact affordance.** `WhatsAppButton` (a single
  floating bubble, suppressed on `/`) replaced by `MobileActionBar`, a bottom
  bar carrying both WhatsApp and call actions, gated on cookie consent and
  site settings. `AnimatedContent` gained `max-md` bottom padding so the bar
  never occludes content. Commit `d4797a41`.
- **CA-02 — Archive greyscale on touch.** `ProjectArchiveCard`'s grayscale +
  brightness treatment moved behind `[@media(hover:hover)]`, so touch devices
  are no longer left with a desaturated image and no hover to restore it.
  Commit `d4797a41`.

Also surfaced Gallery in `navLinks` and repointed the homepage closing
invitation at `/gallery` (its copy already described the gallery), and added
`HomeFAQ` before that invitation. Commit `d6263730`.

Rollback point: tag `checkpoint/v19-pre-30d-primitive-migration`.

**Still open from the audit:** CA-05..CA-18, plus the `PageTransition`
containing-block bug affecting `position: fixed` descendants.

## Phase 30D scope finding — 2026-09-10

Investigating how to resume archived Phases 30D-33 surfaced that the Phase 30
"Rooms" are **admin surfaces, not public pages**:

- `components/primitives/{foundation,interactive}` (the genome-tagged tree,
  `// Genome ID: P007`) is consumed by 17 admin pages and ~40 admin
  components. The entire public site accounts for 5 files.
- 30A Entrance = `AdminAuth`, 30B Gallery = `AdminGallery`, 30C Workspace =
  `pages/admin/workspace/*` (all 5 files migrated). Public `Index`,
  `GalleryPage` and `PriceEstimator` have zero primitive imports.
- "Material Library / Consultation" appears exactly **once** in the whole
  repository — line 64 of `.planning/archive/ENGINEERING_ROADMAP_V1.md`. No
  spec, requirement, or component defines it. `AdminMedia.tsx` (341 lines,
  un-migrated) is the likeliest referent.
- The archived roadmap is superseded by `.planning/milestones/v3.0-ROADMAP.md`
  ("v3.0 DAM V3 Workspace", phases 5-10), which is what this branch is for.

Separately, three primitive locations exist. `ui/primitives/*` (lowercase,
117 importers) is the vendored shadcn base and is legitimate.
`components/primitives/*` (63) and `components/ui/{foundation,interactive}`
(38, including all 15 files in `components/patterns/`) are genuine
duplicates of Container/Stack/Surface/Text/Button/Input. Decision taken:
`components/primitives/*` is canonical.
